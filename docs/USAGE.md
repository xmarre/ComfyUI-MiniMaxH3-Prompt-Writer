# Usage

## Generate a prompt

1. Open the floating **H3 Prompt Writer** button or use **Extensions > H3 Prompt Writer**.
2. Choose a mode.
3. Add the media required by that mode.
4. Set duration and aspect ratio.
5. Describe the intended video in **Creative Brief**.
6. Choose a ready prompt model in **Settings**.
7. Select **Generate prompt**.
8. Review or edit the generated prompt, then select **Copy prompt** and paste it into your H3 workflow.

Prompt Writer creates text. It does not add nodes, modify the graph, or queue a video workflow.

Use the fullscreen button in the Writer header when you want the workspace to fill the browser. Press Escape to leave fullscreen.

## H3 Continuum sequences

**H3 Continuum** is an output target for the five H3 Video modes. It is not a sixth mode. Choose the underlying T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, L2VA, or Reference mode first, then select **H3 Continuum** under **Output target**.

Set **Chunks** from 1 to 16 and **Seconds per chunk** from 4 to 15. Writer shows their total duration but sends the native per-chunk duration to H3. For example, 8 chunks at 6 seconds is a 48-second sequence.

Sequence generation is staged:

1. Writer creates and validates one compact continuity plan for the complete sequence.
2. Writer generates each complete H3 prompt in order, giving the next chunk the saved plan and the previous chunk's prompt.
3. Writer returns deterministic `[Chunk 1]`, `[Chunk 2]`, and later sections accepted by H3 Continuum.

The plan keeps subject identity, wardrobe, environment, camera axis, lighting, sound, dialogue, visible text, constraints, and reference roles stable. A cut or other discontinuity is allowed only when the plan records it as intentional. Prompt models are probabilistic, so review the sequence; Writer validates structure and stable identifiers but cannot guarantee perfect visual continuity from the video model.

Install [ComfyUI H3 Continuum](https://github.com/xmarre/ComfyUI-H3-Continuum) and use **H3 Continuum Sampler V3.4**. Connect a **Text (Multiline)** node to the sampler's **Sequence Prompt** input. **Apply to Continuum** writes the canonical sequence into that connected text widget. If more than one compatible sampler exists, select exactly one on the canvas first. If its chunk settings differ, Writer shows the mismatch and offers an explicit **Sync settings & apply** action. If the text input is missing or connected to a non-editable source, Writer copies the sequence and tells you where to paste it; it does not add or rewire nodes.

For a local change, open **Refine**, select one chunk, and describe the revision. Writer regenerates only that chunk and preserves every other chunk byte-for-byte. H3 Continuum Run Storage hashes the raw prompt of each chunk, so applying such a result lets its partial-regeneration logic preserve the unchanged prefix up to the first changed chunk. Manual edits must keep contiguous, one-based `[Chunk N]` sections before refinement or graph handoff.

The target, settings, validated plan, chunk prompts, and manual draft are saved with the current mode. API credentials are not part of that saved state.

## Modes

| Mode | Input | How the media is used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T2VA | Creative Brief only | Writer builds the full audiovisual timeline from text |
| I2VA | One opening image | `<Picture 1>` is the first frame |
| FL2VA | Opening and closing images | `<Picture 1>` is the first frame and `<Picture 2>` is the last frame |
| L2VA | One closing image | `<Picture 1>` is the last frame |
| Reference | Up to 9 images, 3 videos, and 3 audio files; 12 files total | Each active file can provide a specific subject, setting, motion, camera, style, or sound role |

Duration and aspect ratio become part of the request. The generated text remains editable before you copy it.

## Music 3

Music 3 is a separate workspace for the MiniMax Music 3 model. It writes structured music captions and does not generate H3 video prompts.

Describe the intended sound, vocals, mood, arrangement, and production in **Music Brief**. **Lyrics** is optional. After generation, copy **Generated Caption** to the workflow **Caption** input and pass the original **Lyrics** to the workflow **Lyrics** input.

Use **Refine** under Lyrics to create Lyrics from an empty field or rewrite the current text. Write one instruction for either task. **Use Music Brief** is on by default, so the request can follow the current brief. Turn it off when only the Lyrics and instruction should be sent.

Lyrics change only after a complete response. Cancelling or receiving an error keeps the current text. After a successful request, **Remove generated** returns an empty Lyrics field when the request started empty, while **Restore previous** returns the earlier Lyrics after a rewrite. The instruction stays in the Refine block so you can adjust and reuse it.

Caption Refine uses the current Music Brief, current Lyrics, current caption, and refine instruction. It does not use an older saved copy of the brief or Lyrics.

Music 3 keeps its own saved Music Brief, Lyrics, and edited caption. Open **System prompt** to edit two separate profiles: **Caption** for structured captions and **Lyrics** for creating or rewriting Lyrics. A custom prompt replaces that profile's complete built-in prompt. **Restore default** returns only that profile to its built-in prompt.

## Writing a useful Creative Brief

Write what should happen in ordinary language. You do not need to reproduce the official H3 prompt format. Writer builds that structure for you.

Video Creative Briefs can contain up to 8,000 characters. Music Briefs keep their separate 2,000-character limit.

A useful brief usually says:

- what happens in the video;
- which reference supplies each important detail;
- what must stay unchanged;
- any exact dialogue, visible text, music, or sound;
- which details from a reference must not transfer.

### T2VA example

T2VA has no media, so describe the scene, action, camera, and sound directly:

```text
A tired baker opens a small street bakery before sunrise. Use one continuous slow push-in as he places the first loaf on the counter and says, "First batch of the morning." Quiet street ambience, wooden shutters and a single doorbell. No background music.
```

### I2VA example

The uploaded image is already the opening frame. Describe what happens next instead of restating every visible detail:

```text
Continue naturally from <Picture 1>. The woman notices a paper boat floating past her feet, follows it along the wet pavement and kneels to pick it up. Keep her appearance, clothes and the evening lighting unchanged. The camera slowly pulls back without a cut.
```

### Reference example

Assign a clear role to each file when several references are active:

```text
Use <Picture 1> for the character's face and hair. Use <Picture 2> only for clothes and <Picture 3> for the rainy tram-stop setting. Use only the slow lateral camera movement and pacing from <Video 1>; do not copy its performer, clothes, background, lighting or audio. The character waits alone, notices an approaching light and turns into the wind. End on a quiet close-up.
```

The roles can be short. Phrases such as `use for appearance`, `clothes only`, `background`, `movement only`, `camera motion only`, and `keep the visible text exactly` are enough when the intent is clear.

Every active picture and video in Reference mode belongs to the request. It does not need to become a main subject, but Writer expects the generated prompt to account for it. Uploaded audio remains available in the manifest without automatically becoming part of the prompt. During Generate, an exact canonical tag in the Creative Brief, such as `<Audio 1>`, makes that audio reference required.

### Audio example

Prompt models do not hear the audio file, so describe what should be taken from it:

```text
Use <Audio 1> as the full soundtrack: slow solo piano with three soft notes followed by a long pause. Use <Audio 2> only as a reference for the narrator's low, breathy voice. Do not copy any words from it.
```

Include a transcript when exact speech or lyrics matter. Writer preserves user-supplied dialogue and visible text rather than asking the prompt model to guess them.

## Images and video

Images are sent to the selected multimodal model in reference order. Reordering media renumbers tags within each type.

In Reference mode, select **Replace** on an asset card or drop one new file on the card. The new file keeps the same position in the list. It can be a different media type, so check any Picture, Video, or Audio tags in your brief after replacing it. Dropping several files on a card adds them to the end of the list instead.

For video, Writer prepares an ordered contact sheet. Open a video card to inspect **What the model sees** and choose the available frame-sampling options. The contact sheet still represents the same `<Video N>` reference; it does not create extra `<Picture N>` tags.

Local providers and remote API providers use the prepared contact sheet instead of the original encoded video stream. API providers can receive the derived sheet, but not the original video bytes.

## Audio references

Prompt models do not receive audio bytes. Audio remains a typed `<Audio N>` reference in the request manifest. State its intended role in the brief:

```text
Use <Audio 1> as the full soundtrack.
Use only the rhythm of <Audio 2>; do not copy its voice.
```

Include any transcript, voice description, music style, rhythm, or sound detail that the prompt needs.

Uploading audio alone does not require its tag in the generated prompt. During Generate, only an exact canonical mention such as `<Audio 1>` in the Creative Brief makes that audio reference required. Text without a canonical tag has no structural reference meaning to Writer; the prompt model still interprets its natural-language meaning.

## How Reference mode keeps track of media

Every active picture and video is expected to be accounted for with its exact `<Picture N>` or `<Video N>` tag. Uploaded audio tags are allowed only when they exist in the current manifest. Generate requires the audio tags used in the Creative Brief. Refine preserves audio tags already present in the current prompt unless the revision instruction contains that exact tag.

Use **Insert reference** beside **Refine** to add a current subject, picture, video, or audio tag at the caret in the Creative Brief, Generated Prompt, or Refine instruction.

After generation, Writer checks the required format and exact media tags. A valid prompt is returned without being rewritten. If a visual reference tag is missing, Writer can make one correction using the same prepared media. If the correction does not pass the check, Writer keeps the original prompt and shows a warning instead of hiding the problem.

## Refine

Select **Refine** to rewrite the current prompt from a short revision instruction. Refine uses the currently selected provider and model. It keeps the current task context and media manifest, and uses the prompt visible in the editor, including manual edits. A normal Refine request does not attach prepared image or video payloads again. After a successful rewrite, you can restore the previous prompt.

In Reference mode, Writer preserves an existing audio reference when its exact `<Audio N>` tag is absent from the revision instruction. When the instruction contains that tag, the reference is mutable for this revision: the prompt model decides from the instruction's meaning whether to add it, keep it, change its role, or remove it. The audit accepts either presence or absence and a format-repair pass preserves that decision instead of restoring the previous reference inventory. The next Refine pass uses the resulting current prompt as its audio-reference baseline; the original Creative Brief does not independently restore a tag removed by an earlier revision.

Any canonical reference tag used by the Creative Brief or revision instruction must exist in the current media manifest. A revised prompt containing a tag outside that manifest is rejected by the audit.

Reference video and audio clips must be 2 to 15 seconds long. An audio-only Reference manifest is not valid; add at least one image or video. Each uploaded file is limited to 1 GB.

## Thinking

For Direct GGUF and compatible Ollama models, the **Thinking** switch asks the model to use a larger reasoning budget. Auto context plans for the assembled input, reasoning, and final answer rather than silently shrinking Thinking to save VRAM.

Direct disables Thinking when a manual context is smaller than 16K. Gemma offers 8K, 16K, and 24K presets. Supported Qwen models offer 16K, 24K, 32K, and 48K presets. Direct also accepts an exact Custom Context. Writer counts Qwen input tokens before loading the full model. In Direct Advanced settings, Generation budget can stay on Auto or use a preset or Custom token limit. Reasoning effort appears only when the selected GGUF template declares supported values. Ollama shows the switch only when the model reports Thinking support. API providers manage reasoning separately. Gemini exposes **Minimal**, **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** in API Settings.

If a model still cannot complete Thinking, Writer reports the fallback. It does not present a standard-mode retry as though the full Thinking request succeeded.

## Saved settings and drafts

Writer saves stable preferences in the browser used to open ComfyUI:

- mode, duration, and aspect ratio;
- selected provider and available model preference;
- Direct Context, KV, Generation budget, and reasoning effort preferences;
- Ollama host and the selected model tag for each host;
- External URL and optional Model ID;
- API preset, URL, model ID, Gemini Thinking level, and Custom capabilities;
- custom Standard, Reference, Music 3 Caption, and Music 3 Lyrics system-prompt overrides.

It never saves API keys. If a saved model no longer exists, discovery falls back without treating the missing model as a fatal error.

Every H3 mode keeps its own Creative Brief and editable prompt draft across a page reload. Music 3 separately keeps its Music Brief, Lyrics, and edited caption. Uploaded media is session content and is not restored after reload.

Continuum drafts additionally keep their generation target, chunk settings, validated continuity plan, and individual prompts. This structural state is used for chunk-local refinement; it contains no provider secret or API key.

In **Settings > Prompt behavior**, select **Restore default drafts**. The button changes to **Click again to confirm** for five seconds. Select it again to delete every saved mode draft. The current mode immediately returns to its current built-in Creative Brief and prompt; the other modes use their current built-in defaults when opened. This includes Reference. Media, provider settings, custom system prompts, and API credentials are not changed.

## System prompts

H3 prompt behavior is shared by all providers and has two profiles:

- **Standard** for T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, and L2VA;
- **Reference** for Reference mode.

Editing a profile creates an override of the built-in H3 instruction. It does not replace the separate official MiniMax guide for the selected mode. Resetting an override returns to the current built-in system prompt; there are no separate Standard system prompts for each mode.

Music 3 has a collapsed **System prompt** control in its workspace. It contains separate **Caption** and **Lyrics** profiles. The collapsed row shows **Custom** when either profile has an override. These prompts apply through the selected provider in the same way as the H3 profiles.

## Lifecycle controls

- **Free ComfyUI VRAM** releases workflow models loaded by ComfyUI while preserving cached node results. It is separate from the prompt model.
- **Unload Ollama** releases an idle Ollama model retained by Writer.
- **Unload Direct** releases an idle Direct GGUF model.
- **Cancel** stops the current Writer request.
- **Stop & unload** cancels an active Direct or Ollama request and forces that prompt model to unload at the next safe point.
- **Prompt models · N** groups unload actions when more than one Writer-managed local prompt model remains resident.

**Keep model loaded** applies to Direct and Ollama. It is off by default. External llama.cpp and API providers only use **Cancel** because Writer does not own their server or model lifecycle.

Provider setup details are in [Choose a provider](PROVIDERS.md). Error-specific steps are in [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
